## Project Structure
1. src/services/* - Services that make network requests and data processing code
2. src/components/* - React components
3. App state is managed in the App component using state hooks
4. Styling is done within component files

## Libraries Used
1. Material UI React - I've been wanting to try this library out for a while! I'm using it for the same reason I'd use bootstrap. To leverage components that are cross-browser compatible and responsively designed.
2. Axios - Since the fetch API can behave inconsistently across browsers, I've used axios for network requests.
